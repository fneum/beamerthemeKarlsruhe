# Alternative LaTeX Beamer Template for Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)

This is an *inofficial* LaTeX beamer theme for presentations of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

## Usage

To use it just place the `.sty` files where LaTeX can find them (e.g. your project folder) and include `\usetheme{Karlsruhe}` in the preamble of your `.tex` file. For a title slide at the start of each section use `\usetheme[sectionslides]{Karlsruhe}`.

You can also use the colour theme `beamercolorthemeKarlsruhe.sty` separately with other themes via `\usecolortheme{Karlsruhe}`.

These colour aliases are available for use with `\textcolor{kit-blue100}{example text}`. 

You may also find it convenient to start with the ready-to-use `example.tex` file which includes a few additional design tweaks.
